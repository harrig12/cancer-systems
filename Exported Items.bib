	abstract = {Given the implications of tumor dynamics for precision medicine, there is a need to systematically characterize the mode of evolution across diverse solid tumor types. In particular, methods to infer the role of natural selection within established human tumors are lacking. By simulating spatial tumor growth under different evolutionary modes and examining patterns of between-region subclonal genetic divergence from multi-region sequencing (MRS) data, we demonstrate that it is feasible to distinguish tumors driven by strong positive subclonal selection from those evolving neutrally or under weak selection, as the latter fail to dramatically alter subclonal composition. We developed a classifier based on measures of between-region subclonal genetic divergence and projected patient data into model space, revealing different modes of evolution both within and between solid tumor types. Our findings have broad implications for how human tumors progress, accumulate intra-tumor heterogeneity, and ultimately how they may be more effectively treated.},

	abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) can jointly regulate transcriptional networks in the form of recurrent circuits or motifs. A motif can be divided into a feedforward loop (FFL) and a feedback loop (FBL). Incoherent FFLs have been the recent focus due to their potential to dampen gene expression noise in maintaining physiological norms. However, a cell is not only able to manage noise but also able to exploit it during development or tumorigenesis to initiate radical transformation such as cell differentiation or metastasis. A plausible mechanism may involve reinforcing FBLs (rFBLs), which amplify changes to a sufficient level in order to complete the state transition. To study the behaviour of rFBLs, we developed a novel theoretical framework based on biochemical kinetics. The proposed rFBL follows a parsimonious design, involving two TFs and two miRNAs. A simulation study based on our model suggested that a system with rFBLs is robust to only a certain level of fluctuation but prone to a complete paradigm shift when the change exceeds a threshold level. To investigate the natural occurrence of rFBLs, we performed a rigorous network motif analysis using a recently available TF/miRNA regulatory network from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE). Our analysis suggested that the rFBL is significantly depleted in the observed network. Nonetheless, we identified 9 rFBL instances. Among them, we found a double-rFBL involving three TFs SUZ12/BCLAF1/ZBTB33 and three miRNAs miR-9/19a/129-5p, which together serve as an intriguing toggle switch between nerve development and telomere maintenance. Additionally, we investigated the interactions implicated in the rFBLs using expression profiles of cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Together, we provided a novel and comprehensive view of the profound impacts of rFBLs and highlighted several TFs and miRNAs as the leverage points for potential therapeutic targets in cancers due to their eminent roles in the identified rFBLs.},

	url = {https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2018/9787015/},
	abstract = {The complexity of cancer has motivated the development of different approaches to understand the dynamics of this large group of diseases. One that may allow us to better comprehend the behavior of cancer cells, in both short- and long-term, is mathematical modelling through ordinary differential equations. Several ODE mathematical models concerning tumor evolution and immune response have been formulated through the years, but only a few may exhibit chaotic attractors and oscillations such as stable limit cycles and periodic orbits; these dynamics are not that common among cancer systems. In this paper, we apply the Localization of Compact Invariant Sets (LCIS) method and Lyapunov stability theory to investigate the global dynamics and the main factors involved in tumor growth and immune response for a chaotic-cancer system presented by Itik and Banks in 2010. The LCIS method allows us to compute what we define as the localizing domain, which is formulated by the intersection of all lower and upper bounds of each cells population in the nonnegative octant, . Bounds of this domain are given by inequalities in terms of the system parameters. Then, we apply Lyapunov stability theory and LaSalle’s invariance principle to establish existence conditions of a global attractor. The latter implies that given any nonnegative initial condition, all trajectories will go to the largest compact invariant set (a stable equilibrium point, limit cycles, periodic orbits, or a chaotic attractor) located either inside or at the boundaries of the localizing domain. In order to complement our analysis, numerical simulations are performed throughout the paper to illustrate all mathematical results and to better explain their biological implications.},

	abstract = {Malignant tumor growth, progression and evolution share several of the features associated with strange attractors, a special type of dynamical behavior of non-linear systems. In this framework, the genetic instability of tumor cells represents a local-scale driving force for instability that lets the tumor evolve with time, while selective pressures discarding inefficient cell clones play the role of a dissipative process, providing the tumor with global stability and robustness with respect to perturbations. This setup induces global stability combined with local instability, and is in our opinion the real source of tumor robustness and plasticity, and ultimately the origin of the remarkable resistance of many tumors to anti-cancer therapies. A scientific program taking into consideration the vision of tumors as strange attractors requires the development of experimental and computational tools to link the micro- and mesoscopic perspectives of tumor biology. We here develop the idea of a tumor as a dynamical system, sharing characteristics with strange attractors and investigate several features of such systems, including: (a) local instability combined with global stability, a property inherent to the tremendous non-linearity of the biochemical regulatory circuits governing the individual fate and the interactions between tumor cells; (b) self-similarity at different levels; (c) and strong sensitivity to initial conditions in the composition and features of the tumor and its microenvironment.},

	abstract = {The increasingly evident limitations of target-selective cancer therapy has stimulated a flurry of ideas for overcoming the development of resistance and recurrence – the near universal reason for therapy failure from which target-selective drugs are not exempt. A widely proposed approach to conquer therapy resistance is to depart from the myopic focus on individual causal pathways and instead target multiple nodes in the cancer cell's gene regulatory network. However, most ideas rely on a simplistic conceptualization of networks: utilizing solely their topology and treating it as a display of causal interactions, while ignoring the integrated dynamics in state space. Here, we review the more encompassing formal framework of global network dynamics in which cancer cells, like normal cell types, are high-dimensional attractor states. Then therapy is represented by the network perturbation that will promote the exit from such cancer attractors and reentering a normal attractor. We show in this qualitative and accessible discussion how the idea of a quasi-potential landscape and the theory of least-action-path offer a new formal understanding for computing the set of network nodes (molecular targets) that need to be targeted in concert in order to exit the cancer attractor. But targeting cancer cells based on the network configuration of an “average” cancer cell, however precise, may not suffice to eradicate all tumor cells because of the dynamic non-genetic heterogeneity of cancer cell populations that makes them moving targets and drives the replenishment of the cancer attractor with surviving, non-responsive cells from neighboring abnormal attractors.},

Disruption of these processes by inappropriate regulatory signals and by mutational rewiring of the network can lead to tumorigenesis. Cancer cells often exhibit immature or embryonic traits and dysregulated developmental genes can act as oncogenes. However, the prevailing paradigm of somatic evolution and multi-step tumorigenesis, while useful in many instances, offers no logically coherent reason for why oncogenesis recapitulates ontogenesis. The formal concept of “cancer attractors”, derived from an integrative, complex systems approach to gene regulatory network may provide a natural explanation. Here we present the theory of attractors in gene network dynamics and review the concept of cell types as attractors. We argue that cancer cells are trapped in abnormal attractors and discuss this concept in the light of recent ideas in cancer biology, including cancer genomics and cancer stem cells, as well as the implications for differentiation therapy.},

Systems cancer medicine: towards realization of predictive, preventive, personalized and participatory (P4) medicine (Key Symposium). J Intern Med 2012; 271: 111?121. A grand challenge impeding optimal treatment outcomes for patients with cancer arises from the complex nature of the disease: the cellular heterogeneity, the myriad of dysfunctional molecular and genetic networks as results of genetic (somatic) and environmental perturbations. Systems biology, with its holistic approach to understanding fundamental principles in biology, and the empowering technologies in genomics, proteomics, single-cell analysis, microfluidics and computational strategies, enables a comprehensive approach to medicine, which strives to unveil the pathogenic mechanisms of diseases, identify disease biomarkers and begin thinking about new strategies for drug target discovery. The integration of multidimensional high-throughput ?omics? measurements from tumour tissues and corresponding blood specimens, together with new systems strategies for diagnostics, enables the identification of cancer biomarkers that will enable presymptomatic diagnosis, stratification of disease, assessment of disease progression, evaluation of patient response to therapy and the identification of reoccurrences. Whilst some aspects of systems medicine are being adopted in clinical oncology practice through companion molecular diagnostics for personalized therapy, the mounting influx of global quantitative data from both wellness and diseases is shaping up a transformational paradigm in medicine we termed ?predictive?, ?preventive?, ?personalized?, and ?participatory? (P4) medicine, which requires new strategies, both scientific and organizational, to enable bringing this revolution in medicine to patients and to the healthcare system. P4 medicine will have a profound impact on society ? transforming the healthcare system, turning around the ever escalating costs of healthcare, digitizing the practice of medicine and creating enormous economic opportunities for those organizations and nations that embrace this revolution.},

	abstract = {Model integration – the process by which different modelling efforts can be brought together to simulate the target system – is a core technology in the field of Systems Biology. In the work presented here model integration was addressed directly taking cancer systems as an example. An in-depth literature review was carried out to survey the model forms and types currently being utilised. This was used to formalise the main challenges that model integration poses, namely that of paradigm (the formalism on which a model is based), focus (the real-world system the model represents) and scale.A two-tier model integration strategy, including a knowledge-driven approach to address model semantics, was developed to tackle these challenges. In the first step a novel description of models at the level of behaviour, rather than the precise mathematical or computational basis of the model, is developed by distilling a set of abstract classes and properties. These can accurately describe model behaviour and hence describe focus in a way that can be integrated with behavioural descriptions of other models. In the second step this behaviour is decomposed into an agent-based system by translating the models into local interaction rules.The book provides a detailed and highly integrated presentation of the method, encompassing both its novel theoretical and practical aspects, which will enable the reader to practically apply it to their model integration needs in academic research and professional settings. The text is self-supporting. It also includes an in-depth current bibliography to relevant research papers and literature. The review of the current state of the art in tumour modelling provides added value.},

Certain signatures are associated with age of the patient at cancer diagnosis, known mutagenic exposures or defects in DNA maintenance, but many are of cryptic origin. In addition to these genome-wide mutational signatures, hypermutation localized to small genomic regions, ‘kataegis’, is found in many cancer types. The results reveal the diversity of mutational processes underlying the development of cancer, with potential implications for understanding of cancer aetiology, prevention and therapy.},

Our argument is that the genotype–phenotype map can be characterized by the phase portrait of the underlying regulatory process. The features of this portrait – such as attractors with associated basins and their bifurcations – define the regulatory and evolutionary potential of a system. We show how the geometric analysis of phase space connects Waddington's epigenetic landscape to recent computational approaches for the study of robustness and evolvability in network evolution. We discuss how the geometry of phase space determines the probability of possible phenotypic transitions. Finally, we demonstrate how the active, self-organizing role of the environment in phenotypic evolution can be understood in terms of dynamical systems concepts. This approach yields mechanistic explanations that go beyond insights based on the simulation of evolving regulatory networks alone. Its predictions can now be tested by studying specific, experimentally tractable regulatory systems using the tools of modern systems biology. A systematic exploration of such systems will enable us to understand better the nature and origin of the phenotypic variability, which provides the substrate for evolution by natural selection.},

But progress is being made toward an understanding of such principles by efforts to catalog protein folds and protein–protein interactions. Even plants and animals show convergent evolution, possibly driven by underlying evolutionary basins of attraction. Physical and chemical parameters and the properties of proteins present in the last common ancestor of these 2 taxa, including a putative connexin ancestor, may have played key roles here. Thus evolution is perhaps not as random as is sometimes depicted, but will follow predefined pathways. Here I address convergent evolution in plants and animals beginning at the molecular level and progressing to the organismic one.},

	abstract = {In 1932 Wright introduced the notion of the fitness landscape. By analogy with a physical landscape, whose gradient predicts a rolling marble’s spatial trajectory, the contours of the fitness landscape are meant to predict an evolving population’s genetic trajectory. Wright’s chief interest was in the possibility that mutational interactions might frustrate natural selection, giving rise to multiple maxima on the fitness landscape. Here we study a dynamical system over the state space defined by allele frequencies and linkage disequilibria between alleles. We first analytically locate the saddle between basins of attraction in infinite-sized populations evolving under the influence of selection and recombination for the simplest two-locus case. We further show numerically that the boundary between basins is approximately linear with respect to linkage disequilibrium, though not allele frequency. We also employ this framework to develop novel perspectives on two venerable results for single-peaked fitness landscapes. Finally we sought the potential function whose contours would predict evolutionary trajectories through this state space. Importantly not every dynamical system can be described by a potential function, and the present problem is provably one such case. Thus in the parlance of Wright’s analogy, in locating the floor of the fitness valley we have lost the landscape, and this conclusion is not limited to our choice of parameterization, nor of problem. This result motivates us to carefully review the formal implications and requirements of this widely used analogy.},

Subsequently, they were also found to be able to kill cells that are infected with certain viruses and to attack preferentially cells that lack expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens. The recent discovery of novel NK receptors and their ligands has uncovered the molecular mechanisms that regulate NK activation and function. Several activating NK cell receptors and costimulatory molecules have been identified that permit these cells to recognize tumors and virus-infected cells. These are modulated by inhibitory receptors that sense the levels of MHC class I on prospective target cells to prevent unwanted destruction of healthy tissues. In vitro and in vivo, their cytotoxic ability can be enhanced by cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-2, IL-12, IL-15 and interferon alpha/beta (IFN-alpha/beta). In animal studies, they have been shown to play a critical role in the control of tumor growth and metastasis and to provide innate immunity against infection with certain viruses. Following activation, NK cells release cytokines and chemokines that induce inflammatory responses; modulate monocyte, dendritic cells, and granulocyte growth and differentiation; and influence subsequent adaptive immune responses. The underlining mechanism of discriminating tumor cells and normal cells by NK cells has provided new insights into tumor immunosurveillance and has suggested new strategies for the treatment of human cancer.},

	abstract = {The observed intercellular heterogeneity within a clonal cell population can be mapped as dynamical states clustered around an attractor point in gene expression space, owing to a balance between homeostatic forces and stochastic fluctuations. These dynamics have led to the cancer cell attractor conceptual model, with implications for both carcinogenesis and new therapeutic concepts. Immortalized and malignant EBV-carrying B-cell lines were used to explore this model and characterize the detailed structure of cell attractors. Any subpopulation selected from a population of cells repopulated the whole original basin of attraction within days to weeks. Cells at the basin edges were unstable and prone to apoptosis. Cells continuously changed states within their own attractor, thus driving the repopulation, as shown by fluorescent dye tracing. Perturbations of key regulatory genes induced a jump to a nearby attractor. Using the Fokker-Planck equation, this cell population behavior could be described as two virtual, opposing influences on the cells: one attracting toward the center and the other promoting diffusion in state space (noise). Transcriptome analysis suggests that these forces result from high-dimensional dynamics of the gene regulatory network. We propose that they can be generalized to all cancer cell populations and represent intrinsic behaviors of tumors, offering a previously unidentified characteristic for studying cancer.},

	abstract = {Background
Cancer is a complex disease that involves a sequence of gene-environment interactions in a progressive process that cannot occur without dysfunction in multiple systems, including DNA repair, apoptotic and immune functions. Epigenetic mechanisms, responding to numerous internal and external cues in a dynamic ongoing exchange, play a key role in mediating environmental influences on gene expression and tumor development.

Hypothesis
The hypothesis put forth in this paper addresses the limited success of treatment outcomes in clinical oncology. It states that improvement in treatment efficacy requires a new paradigm that focuses on reversing systemic dysfunction and tailoring treatments to specific stages in the process. It requires moving from a reductionist framework of seeking to destroy aberrant cells and pathways to a transdisciplinary systems biology approach aimed at reversing multiple levels of dysfunction.

Conclusion
Because there are many biological pathways and multiple epigenetic influences working simultaneously in the expression of cancer phenotypes, studying individual components in isolation does not allow an adequate understanding of phenotypic expression. A systems biology approach using new modeling techniques and nonlinear mathematics is needed to investigate gene-environment interactions and improve treatment efficacy. A broader array of study designs will also be required, including prospective molecular epidemiology, immune competent animal models and in vitro/in vivo translational research that more accurately reflects the complex process of tumor initiation and progression.},

Cancer is primarily a somatic genetic disease resulting from the accumulation of several precancerous mutations in a cell lineage. The evolution of highly oncogenic retroviruses has been used as a model for the evolution of a cancer cell. The properties of intermediates between one set of replication-competent retrovirus and protooncogene progenitors and the homologous highly oncogenic retrovirus were analyzed to differentiate between selection-driven and mutation-driven models of this evolution. In this case and in some other cases where sufficient data are available, it appears that the intermediates in the evolution of highly oncogenic retroviruses are not transforming, indicating that they were not formed in a purely selection-driven process. Furthermore, analysis of retrovirus mutation rates indicates that there is a high rate of mutation in retrovirus replication such that the evolution of highly oncogenic retroviruses could be mutation-driven. Other evidence is mentioned suggesting that oncogenesis in general is at least partially mutation-driven, although mutational mechanisms are involved that are different from those involved in the evolution of highly oncogenic retroviruses.},

	abstract = {Lung cancer was once a very rare disease, so rare that doctors took special notice when confronted with a case, thinking it a once-in-a-lifetime oddity. Mechanisation and mass marketing towards the end of the 19th century popularised the cigarette habit, however, causing a global lung cancer epidemic. Cigarettes were recognised as the cause of the epidemic in the 1940s and 1950s, with the confluence of studies from epidemiology, animal experiments, cellular pathology and chemical analytics. Cigarette manufacturers disputed this evidence, as part of an orchestrated conspiracy to salvage cigarette sales. Propagandising the public proved successful, judging from secret tobacco industry measurements of the impact of denialist propaganda. As late as 1960 only one-third of all US doctors believed that the case against cigarettes had been established. The cigarette is the deadliest artefact in the history of human civilisation. Cigarettes cause about 1 lung cancer death per 3 or 4 million smoked, which explains why the scale of the epidemic is so large today. Cigarettes cause about 1.5 million deaths from lung cancer per year, a number that will rise to nearly 2 million per year by the 2020s or 2030s, even if consumption rates decline in the interim. Part of the ease of cigarette manufacturing stems from the ubiquity of high-speed cigarette making machines, which crank out 20 000 cigarettes per min. Cigarette makers make about a penny in profit for every cigarette sold, which means that the value of a life to a cigarette maker is about US\$10 000.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) profiling for smoking behaviour have given rise to a new, molecular biomarker of smoking exposure. It is unclear whether a smoking-associated DNAm (epigenetic) score has predictive value for ageing-related health outcomes which is independent of contributions from self-reported (phenotypic) smoking measures. Blood DNA methylation levels were measured in 895 adults aged 70 years in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936) study using the Illumina 450K assay. A DNA methylation score based on 230 CpGs was used as a proxy for smoking exposure. Associations between smoking variables and health outcomes at age 70 were modelled using general linear modelling (ANCOVA) and logistic regression. Additional analyses of smoking with brain MRI measures at age 73 (n = 532) were performed. Smoking-DNAm scores were positively associated with self-reported smoking status (P {\textless} 0.001, eta-squared ɳ2 = 0.63) and smoking pack years (r = 0.69, P {\textless} 0.001). Higher smoking DNAm scores were associated with variables related to poorer cognitive function, structural brain integrity, physical health, and psychosocial health. Compared with phenotypic smoking, the methylation marker provided stronger associations with all of the cognitive function scores, especially visuospatial ability (P {\textless} 0.001, partial eta-squared ɳp2 = 0.022) and processing speed (P {\textless} 0.001, ɳp2 = 0.030); inflammatory markers (all P {\textless} 0.001, ranges from ɳp2 = 0.021 to 0.030); dietary patterns (healthy diet (P {\textless} 0.001, ɳp2 = 0.052) and traditional diet (P {\textless} 0.001, ɳp2 = 0.032); stroke (P = 0.006, OR 1.48, 95\% CI 1.12, 1.96); mortality (P {\textless} 0.001, OR 1.59, 95\% CI 1.42, 1.79), and at age 73; with MRI volumetric measures (all P {\textless} 0.001, ranges from ɳp2 = 0.030 to 0.052). Additionally, education was the most important life-course predictor of lifetime smoking tested. Our results suggest that a smoking-associated methylation biomarker typically explains a greater proportion of the variance in some smoking-related morbidities in older adults, than phenotypic measures of smoking exposure, with some of the accounted-for variance being independent of phenotypic smoking status.},

These effects have been shown to persist across subsequent generations, regardless of the offsprings’ smoking habits. Established epigenetic modifications induced by in utero exposure are postulated as the mechanism underlying the inherited poor respiratory outcomes. As e-cigarette use is on the rise, their potential to induce similar functional respiratory deficits underpinned by an alteration in the foetal epigenome needs to be explored. This review will focus on the functional and epigenetic impact of in utero exposure to maternal cigarette smoke, maternal environmental tobacco smoke, environmental tobacco smoke and e-cigarette vapour on foetal respiratory outcomes.},

Humans are vulnerable to nicotine addiction, and the most marketable form of nicotine delivery is the most harmful. A tobacco use management system has evolved out of governments’ attempts to regulate tobacco marketing and use and to support services that provide information about tobacco's harms and discourage its use. Our analysis identified 5 systemic problems that constrain progress toward the elimination of tobacco-related harm. We argue that this goal would be more readily achieved if the regulatory subsystem had dynamic power to regulate tobacco products and the tobacco industry as well as a responsive process for resourcing tobacco use control activities.},

	abstract = {In the years following her role as the lead author of the international bestseller, Limits to Growth—the first book to show the consequences of unchecked growth on a finite planet— Donella Meadows remained a pioneer of environmental and social analysis until her untimely death in 2001.Meadows' newly released manuscript, Thinking in Systems, is a concise and crucial book offering insight for problem solving on scales ranging from the personal to the global. Edited by the Sustainability Institute's Diana Wright, this essential primer brings systems thinking out of the realm of computers and equations and into the tangible world, showing readers how to develop the systems-thinking skills that thought leaders across the globe consider critical for 21st-century life.Some of the biggest problems facing the world—war, hunger, poverty, and environmental degradation—are essentially system failures. They cannot be solved by fixing one piece in isolation from the others, because even seemingly minor details have enormous power to undermine the best efforts of too-narrow thinking.While readers will learn the conceptual tools and methods of systems thinking, the heart of the book is grander than methodology. Donella Meadows was known as much for nurturing positive outcomes as she was for delving into the science behind global dilemmas. She reminds readers to pay attention to what is important, not just what is quantifiable, to stay humble, and to stay a learner.In a world growing ever more complicated, crowded, and interdependent, Thinking in Systems helps readers avoid confusion and helplessness, the first step toward finding proactive and effective solutions.},

To estimate the fraction of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia-2 (CIN-2) that might regress if untreated using data from the atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) triage study (ALTS).

Methods
We compared the cumulative occurrence of CIN-2 (n = 397) and CIN-3 or worse (n = 542) diagnosed by the Pathology Quality Control Group in three trial arms— immediate colposcopy, human papillomavirus (HPV) triage, and conservative management— over the 2-year duration of the ALTS trial. A non-parametric test of trend was used to test for differences in the number of CIN-2 cases relative to number of CIN-3 or worse cases across study arms, with an increasing percentage of women referred to colposcopy at baseline.

Results
There were no significant differences in the cumulative 2-year cumulative CIN-3 or worse diagnoses by study arm (10.9\%, conservative management; 10.3\%, HPV; 10.9\%, immediate colposcopy) (ptrend = 0.8) but there was a significant increase in CIN-2 diagnoses (5.8\%, conservative management; 7.8\%, HPV triage; 9.9\%, immediate colposcopy) (ptrend {\textless} 0.001) in the study arms with increasing number of women referred to colposcopy at baseline. The relative differences in CIN-2 by study arm among women who tested HPV16 positive at baseline were less pronounced (ptrend = 0.1) than women who tested positive for other high-risk HPV genotypes (ptrend = 0.01).

Conclusions
There was evidence that approximately 40\% of undiagnosed CIN-2 will regress over 2 years but CIN-2 caused by HPV16 may be less likely to regress than CIN-2 caused by other high-risk HPV genotypes.},

	abstract = {A tumor often consists of multiple cell subpopulations (clones). Current chemo-treatments often target one clone of a tumor. Although the drug kills that clone, other clones overtake it and the tumor recurs. Genome sequencing and computational analysis allows to computational dissection of clones from tumors, while singe-cell genome sequencing including RNA-Seq allows profiling of these clones. This opens a new window for treating a tumor as a system in which clones are evolving. Future cancer systems biology studies should consider a tumor as an evolving system with multiple clones. Therefore, topics discussed in Part 2 of this review include evolutionary dynamics of clonal networks, early-warning signals (e.g., genome duplication events) for formation of fast-growing clones, dissecting tumor heterogeneity, and modeling of clone–clone–stroma interactions for drug resistance. The ultimate goal of the future systems biology analysis is to obtain a ‘whole-system’ understanding of a tumor and therefore provides a more efficient and personalized management strategies for cancer patients.},

Here, we review data and technologies that have revealed intra-tumor heterogeneity across cancer types and the dynamics, constraints, and contingencies inherent to tumor evolution. We emphasize the importance of macro-evolutionary leaps, often involving large-scale chromosomal alterations, in driving tumor evolution and metastasis and consider the role of the tumor microenvironment in engendering heterogeneity and drug resistance. We suggest that bold approaches to drug development, harnessing the adaptive properties of the immune-microenvironment while limiting those of the tumor, combined with advances in clinical trial-design, will improve patient outcome.},
